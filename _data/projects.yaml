  - title: CodeNation
    desc: Code Nation provides underprivlidged kids the tools necessary to both learn to code, and create career oppurtunities in tech. As a volunteer, I spend twice a week throughout the school year working with high schoolers to learn web development. With a classroom of around 12 kids, it's incredible to see how much they learn in such a short period of time.

  - title: Tech for Development in Tanzania
    desc: Spent a month in Tanzania setting up computer systems in 5 different schools. This involved laying electrical and ethernet wiring, setting up a server, and mounting wireless access points. We trained teachers and students to use these computers to further their ability to both teach and learn.
